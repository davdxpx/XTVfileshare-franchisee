# Support for XTV Fileshare Bot - Franchisee Edition

Need help with your Franchisee setup? We're here to assist you.

## How do I get a Franchisee ID?

To run the Franchisee Edition, you need a valid `FRANCHISEE_ID` and `FRANCHISEE_PASSWORD`, along with connection details for the `MAIN_URI` and `USER_URI` databases.

These credentials are **strictly controlled** and issued only to authorized partners.

*   **Subject:** Request Franchisee Credentials.

## Where can I get help?
