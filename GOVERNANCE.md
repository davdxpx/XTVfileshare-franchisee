# Governance Model

The **XTV Fileshare Bot - Franchisee Edition** operates under a **Benevolent Dictator for Life (BDFL)** model, with a clear distinction between the Core (Proprietary) and Franchisee (Partner) components.

## Roles and Responsibilities

### 1. The CEO / Lead Developer (BDFL)
*   **Who:** [@davdxpx](https://t.me/davdxpx) (𝕏0L0™)
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Maintains the proprietary Global Database (MainDB) and backend infrastructure.
    *   Has final say on all architectural decisions, feature inclusions, and security protocols.
    *   Issues and revokes Franchisee credentials (`FRANCHISEE_ID`).
    *   Manages the global content library and push approvals.

### 2. Franchisees (Partners)
*   **Who:** Licensed operators running their own instance of this bot.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Manage their local community and PrivateDB channels.
    *   Suggest features and report bugs via the issue tracker or direct support.
    *   Submit local content for global push requests (subject to approval).
    *   Respect the Code of Conduct and Terms of Service.

### 3. Contributors
*   **Who:** Anyone submitting Pull Requests or Issues to this public repository.
*   **Responsibilities:**
    *   Improvements to the public-facing franchisee code are welcome.
    *   Must sign off that contributions can be licensed under the project's proprietary terms.

## Decision Making Process

*   **Feature Requests:** Proposals are reviewed by the CEO. Features that benefit the entire ecosystem (Global) are prioritized over niche local requests.
*   **Bug Fixes:** Critical security patches are applied immediately. Logic fixes are reviewed and merged based on stability testing.
*   **Disputes:** In the event of a disagreement, the CEO has the final casting vote to ensure the integrity and security of the XTV network.

This governance model is subject to change as the project scales.
